A string is balanced if it consists of exactly two different characters and both of those characters appear exactly the same number of times. For example: "aabbab" is balanced (both 'a' and 'b' occur three times) but "aabba" is not balanced ('a' occurs three times, 'b' occurs two times). String "aabbcc" is also not balanced (it contains three different letters).

A substring of string S is a string that consists of consecutive letters in S. For example: "ompu" is a substring of "computer" but "cmptr" is not.

Write a function solution that, given a string S, returns the length of the longest balanced substring of S.

Examples:

1. Given S = "cabbacc", the function should return 4 ("abba" is the longest balanced substring).

2. Given S = "abababa", the function should return 6 ("ababab" and "bababa" are the longest balanced substrings).

3. Given S = "aaaaaaa", the function should return 0 (S does not contain a balanced substring).

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
string S is made only of lowercase letters (aâˆ’z).
