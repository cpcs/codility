Recently, more and more illegal street races have been spotted at night in the city, and they have become a serious threat to public safety. Therefore, the Police Chief has decided to deploy speed cameras on the streets to collect evidence.

There are N+1 intersections in the city, connected by N roads. Every road has the same length of 1. A street race may take place between any two different intersections by using the roads connecting them. Limited by their budget, the police are able to deploy at most K speed cameras on these N roads. These K speed cameras should be installed such that the length of any possible street race route not covered by speed cameras should be as short as possible.

You are given a map of the city in the form of two arrays, A and B of length N, and an integer K:

For each J (0 â‰¤ J < N) there is a road connecting intersections A[J] and B[J].
The Police Chief would like to know the minimum length of the longest path out of surveillance after placing at most K speed cameras.

Write a function:

int solution(vector<int> &A, vector<int> &B, int K);

that, given arrays A and B of N integers and integer K, returns the minimum length of the longest path unmonitored by speed cameras after placing at most K speed cameras.

For example, given K = 2 and the following arrays:

  A[0] = 5    B[0] = 1  
  A[1] = 1    B[1] = 0  
  A[2] = 0    B[2] = 7   
  A[3] = 2    B[3] = 4   
  A[4] = 7    B[4] = 2  
  A[5] = 0    B[5] = 6  
  A[6] = 6    B[6] = 8  
  A[7] = 6    B[7] = 3  
  A[8] = 1    B[8] = 9

the function should return 2. Two speed cameras can be installed on the roads between intersections 1 and 0 and between intersections 0 and 7. (Another solution would be to install speed cameras between intersections 0 and 7 and between intersections 0 and 6.) By installing speed cameras according the first plan, one of the longest paths without a speed camera starts at intersection 8, passes through intersection 6 and ends at intersection 3, which consists of two roads. (Other longest paths are composed of intersections 5, 1, 9 and 7, 2, 4).

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

N is an integer within the range [1..50,000];
each element of arrays A and B is an integer within the range [0..N];
K is an integer within the range [0..N];
the distance between any two intersections is not greater than 900.
